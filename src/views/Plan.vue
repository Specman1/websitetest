                        Day Out With Thomas and Santa Steam Trains which are extremely busy and not the best experience for our four legged friends!
                        <br /><br />
                        On standard days well behaved dogs are welcome on the trains but only in the standard class open carriages,
                        i.e. tables of up to four. On the platforms dogs must be kept on a lead at all times. We do not allow dogs
                        in our compartment or first class coaches.
                        <br /><br />
                        We also ask that dogs are kept off the seats too, please.
                        <br /><br />
                        Dogs are not allowed in the Station Buffet at Boâ€™ness but food and drinks from the menu can be taken
                        away and enjoyed at picnic benches around the site.`
